That&#x27;s a small world. Maybe you would talk to a friend who works for intelligence agencies and find out what they are looking for.<p>And the reverse happens too. If you&#x27;ve explored the design space for an intelligence agency, you would be well-positioned to re-use that knowledge for a space telescope. You mention the classification barrier, but the basic physics drivers will be more apparent the second time around.<p>Case in point: Larry James (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;bio_james.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;bio_james.php</a>), who is the Deputy Director for JPL, but who used to be Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance at the Pentagon, and who before <i>that</i> was a Shuttle payload specialist. He&#x27;s a technical executive, but there are pure technical examples as well.<p>OK, and a second example, of a segmented mirror demonstrator: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nps.edu&#x2F;About&#x2F;News&#x2F;NPS-New-Home-for-Giant-Segmented-Mirror-Space-Telescope-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nps.edu&#x2F;About&#x2F;News&#x2F;NPS-New-Home-for-Giant-Segment...</a> (&quot;NASAâ€™s James Webb Space Telescope, named for the former NASA administrator and scheduled for launch in 2014 [<i>erp!</i>], will deploy the next generation of SMT technology on a mission to image light from the earliest galaxies in the universe.&quot;)";

If it were, you would not need to call it a signal, it would be simply &quot;sound&quot;. In a slightly different use of adjective, an acoustic signal is a signal (that may or not be audio, eg, ultrassound) that is carried by sound waves.<p>Actually, it only gets confusing if you try to be pedantic, as GP did.
